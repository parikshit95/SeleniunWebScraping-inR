# SeleniunWebScraping-in R

Using remote web driver Selenium, I could scrape google maps to retrieve coordinates for around 1,700 wind farms in India. 
These coordinates were then used to get data for wind flows and the statistical analysis of these wind farms for another project.
Selenium is a powerful tool for web-automation. The R files here are an example for how Selenium can be implemented.

Also, I used a different approach by using google's API to achieve a similar task for validation of Selenium. The API is a more
efficient approach.
